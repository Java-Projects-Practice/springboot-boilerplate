# 🌱 Spring Boot Boilerplate

This is a minimal and production-ready Spring Boot starter project that confirms successful setup with a simple `"Spring Boot Project Running Successfully!"` message on the root endpoint.

Designed for developers who want a clean, quick-start backend foundation without unnecessary complexity — ideal for microservices, REST APIs, or learning the Spring ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

This boilerplate includes:

- ✅ Spring Boot 3.x setup using Maven
- ✅ REST controller with root `/` endpoint for quick health check or initial test
- ✅ Clean folder structure for easy scalability
- ✅ Lightweight, no database or frontend — you add what you need

> 🔍 Access the root endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/` to verify that your Spring Boot environment is running successfully.
